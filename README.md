 ## Healthcare Dashboard UI (React Prototype)

A modern and intuitive Healthcare Dashboard User Interface prototype built with React.js using **Vite**. This project focuses on demonstrating a clean, component-based frontend architecture and a user-friendly design for a potential patient health management system.

 ## üåü Overview

This project is a static UI prototype of a healthcare dashboard. It showcases a comprehensive layout for managing patient health information, appointments, and activity tracking. While the advanced functionalities (like live data fetching, interactive chart updates, or full calendar interactivity) are not implemented in this prototype, it serves as a strong demonstration of frontend development skills using React and modern UI design principles.
